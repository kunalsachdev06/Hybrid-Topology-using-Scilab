A university campus network is designed in such a way that the computers within each department are connected using a star topology for efficient management, while all departments are interconnected using a ring topology to ensure reliable communication across the campus. Additionally, older laboratory systems and legacy computers are connected using a bus topology to minimize infrastructure cost. The bus network is connected to the ring network, and the ring network is connected to the star network, forming a hybrid topology. Based on this scenario, identify the type of topology used and explain how the combination of bus, ring, and star topologies improves network performance, scalability, and fault tolerance.
